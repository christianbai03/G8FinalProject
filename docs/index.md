1. Choose one advanced information technology (e.g., ChatGPT, generative AI, voice recognition technology, etc.)
2. Find applications of the chosen technology in the real-world settings using news articles, academic papers, and/or official blogs/websites
3. Provide critical discussion of both the chosen technology and its applications using at least two different ethical lenses
