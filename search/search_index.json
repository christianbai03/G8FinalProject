This study performed several thousand tests and they found there were different values and bias within the different ChatGPT models. If one were to ask the ChatGPT bot about politics, they would find that the bot that learns and adapts would build up based off user feedback and that is an issue. Polarising world events, like the Russia-Ukraine war, could also amplify what users are asking the LLMs and the resulting answers they get. This indicates that AI chatbots could be having hallucinations, and it shows there is a harm with misinformation as it is not specialised and those risks should be carefully evaluated.</p> <p>Source:  </p> <ul> <li>ChatGPT Turns Two: What's Next for the OpenAI Chatbot That Broke New Ground for AI \u2013 Euronews</li> </ul>"},{"location":"analysis/#ethical-lenses","title":"Ethical Lenses","text":""},{"location":"analysis/#utilitarianism","title":"Utilitarianism","text":"<p>Pros: Boosts productivity and helps people attain knowledge quickly and helps students who don\u2019t have tutors.

While many people believe that students only use this AI to cheat, there are actually multiple ways it can be used to aid learning. It has become such a common tool for students to use that some schools have banned the use of it. ChatGPT can be used as a tutor.
